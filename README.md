# Udacity: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to create an etl pipeline using Python to build a NoSQL database from csv files for a music streaming service (Sparkify). This is a music streaming service who have user activity along with song data and wish to exploit their user data to grow. This project is performed using Apache Cassandra.

## How to Run

Project is run via the "Project_2.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook.
